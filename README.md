# android-app

Me and two of my fellow students in the context of a class we had back in 2014 we've created 
an android mobile application. It is an information and navigation application.

The initial screen brings up google maps and the user can create and save markers in his favourite spots
(the markers are saved in an SQLite database). He can also use these markers in order to create a route 
between them.

Read the report.pdf for further information about how the app works.
